# UI Abstraction Ideas

This file lists potential UI functionalities that could be abstracted into reusable utilities or Svelte actions to improve consistency and development speed.

## 1. Click Outside Detection

*   **Use Case:** Closing dropdown menus, modals, or popovers when the user clicks anywhere outside of them.
*   **Abstraction Idea:** A function or Svelte action (`use:clickOutside`) that takes an element and a callback function. The callback is executed when a click occurs outside the specified element.

## 2. Debounce and Throttle Functions

*   **Use Case:** Limiting the rate at which a function is called. Debouncing is good for things like search input (wait until the user stops typing), and throttling is good for resize or scroll events (fire at most once every X milliseconds).
*   **Abstraction Idea:** Higher-order functions `debounce(callback, delay)` and `throttle(callback, delay)` that return new, rate-limited versions of the callback.

## 3. Element Resize Observation

*   **Use Case:** Reacting to changes in an element's size, perhaps to adjust layout, recalculate something, or trigger different visual states. This is like `IntersectionObserver` but for dimensions.
*   **Abstraction Idea:** A function `observeResize(element, callback)` that uses `ResizeObserver` internally. The callback would receive the new dimensions or the `ResizeObserverEntry`.

## 4. Focus Trap

*   **Use Case:** Keeping keyboard focus within a modal dialog or an active off-canvas menu, which is crucial for accessibility.
*   **Abstraction Idea:** A Svelte action (`use:focusTrap`) or a pair of functions `trapFocus(element)` and `releaseFocus()` that manage focus within the given container.

## 5. Scroll Lock

*   **Use Case:** Preventing the main page from scrolling when a modal or overlay is open.
*   **Abstraction Idea:** Functions `lockScroll()` and `unlockScroll()` that add/remove styles or event listeners to the `body` to prevent scrolling. This could also be a Svelte action.

## 6. Unique ID Generator

*   **Use Case:** Generating unique IDs for form elements and their labels (`for`/`id` attributes), or for `aria-labelledby` / `aria-describedby` relationships, which is important for accessibility.
*   **Abstraction Idea:** A simple function `generateId(prefix = 'ui')` that returns a string like `ui-12345`.

## 7. Local Storage Svelte Store

*   **Use Case:** Creating Svelte stores that automatically persist their state to `localStorage` and rehydrate from it on page load.
*   **Abstraction Idea:** A function `createLocalStorageStore(key, initialValue)` that returns a Svelte writable store with this added persistence behavior.
